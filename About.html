        <h2>My Journey Into the Industry...</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>The Beginning</h3>

            <div class="begin">

            <p> My name is Danyel De Villiers,and I am third generation Cuban-American. Growing up, I was raised around the field of education. Both my parents are educators, and for the majority of my youth, I would volunteer as a counselor and tutor for many of their students. This changed, however, when I entered my freshman year at Christopher Columbus High School. My interest in Broadcast Journalism dates back to the summer of 2013, when I auditioned for CCNN Live, the daily news show for Christopher Columbus High School. I had never been exposed to any form of journalism prior to joining the program, but they next four years would change my entire life. My experiences throughout high school were nothing short of amazing. The exposure and knowledge I received into the vast industry of journalism only proved my commitment to the field. I was able to compete at the state and national level in various competitions, earning myself three Suncoast Student Emmy awards by the age of 17. When I graduated high school, I wanted to continue my studies at a college program that would both challenge me and teach me. Thus, I enrolled into the University of Miami School of Communication in the Spring of 2018.</p>

          <h3>Danyel to the "U"</h3>

          <div class="theU">

            <p>The University of Miami has been my dream school ever since I was a young boy. My parents were both graduates of the institution, and after attending the Peace Sullivan/James Ansin High School Workshop at the university, I knew that this was the school I had to attend. During my time at UM, I have been an active member for various programs on the University’s television station UMTV. I currently serve as an executive producer for the school’s weekly live sports broadcast, SportsDesk and as an associate producer and director for UniMiami, the school’s Spanish broadcast. I have been exposed to multiple elements of live news reporting and have taken a great interest in the production side of things. SportDesk has been recognized nationaly as one of the student-run sports programs and has recieved multiple 1st Place awards for production.</p>

          <h3>Going Professional</h3>

          <div class= "professional">

            <p>Upon graduating high school, I founded my own media company, DD Media Productions. I focus my work in the South Florida Area and  offer clients high quality productions that are also reasonably priced. As President and CEO, I oversee the production of cinematic style videography for Weddings, Quinces, special event coverage, and marketing. My equipment includes top of the line cameras, drones, and soundboards. I am very passionate about DD Media Productions and my goal is to capture the moment.</p>
