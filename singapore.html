        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The earliest records of Singapore's history, described it as <em>"Pu-luo-chung"</em>, referring to "Pulau Ujong" which means the <em>"island at the end of a peninsula"</em> in the Malay language.</p>

        <p>The first settlement on the country was established between 1298 to 1299 AD where it was referred to as the <em>Temasek</em> or "Sea Town". The settlement saw several changes in leadership and government in the years that followed. The country then lost all control and the land fell out of the spotlight for several decades.</p>

        <p>It wasn't until 1819, that the British founded and colonized Singapore as a haven for trading under the leadership of Sir Thomas Raffles. Raffles stated the country was in an ideal location for trading since it could avoid any interferences from the Dutch. He negotiated a treaty with the local rulers of the time to establish Singapore as an offical trading station. After this the country boomed, attracting migrants from all parts of Asia to colonize in the country.</p>

        <p>Singapore prospered for decades to come, but the effects of World War II took a major blow on the economy. The Japanese invaded singapore in December 1941 and British Forces surrendered the country on Chinese New Year, February 1942. At the time this surrender was the largest recorded in British history, but in 1945 they regained control of Singapore and a year later Singapore became a British Crown Colony.</p>

        <p>It joined as a member of the Malaysian Federation in 1963, but two years later the country declared its independence.</p>

        <p>Today, Singapore is one of the world's most wealthy and beautiful countries with one of the strongest and most productive trading outposts in the world.</p>

        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <h3>Economic Overview</h3>

        <p>Singapore is one of the most high developed and prosperous free-market economies in the World. It has a much higher market value compared to other developed countries and the unemployment rate is very low.</p>

        <p>The idea behind retructuring the economy is to reduce its dependence on foreign labor, raise the growth in productivity, and increase wages. They also aim to slow down the growth in labor forces to assist the aging population within the country.</p>
